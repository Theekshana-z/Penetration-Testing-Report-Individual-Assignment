# Penetration Testing Report – Individual Assignment

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **3rd Year, 1st Semester** Individual Assignment for the **Applied Information Assurance (AIA)** module at SLIIT. The project focuses on conducting a penetration test to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in a simulated environment.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The repository includes the following file:

* `IT22083678.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the penetration testing process, findings, and recommendations.

## 🔐 About Penetration Testing

Penetration testing, or ethical hacking, involves simulating cyberattacks on systems to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. The process typically includes:

* **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target system.
* **Scanning**: Identifying open ports and services.
* **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
* **Post-Exploitation**: Assessing the impact of successful exploitation.
* **Reporting**: Documenting findings and providing remediation recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used

During the penetration testing process, various tools and techniques were employed, including:
  m`
* **Kali Linux**: A Linux distribution with pre-installed tools for penetration testing.
* **Nmap**: A network scanning tool for discovering hosts and services.
* **Burp Suite**: A web vulnerability scanner for identifying issues in web applications.
* **Metasploit**: A framework for developing and executing exploit code.

## 📄 Documentation

The `IT22083678.pdf` file provides a detailed analysis of:

* **Test Objectives**: The goals and scope of the penetration test.
* **Methodology**: The approach and tools used during testing.
* **Findings**: Identified vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
* **Recommendations**: Suggested remediation actions to mitigate risks.
